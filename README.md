# ResQRoute: Al-Powered Real-Time Ambulance Navigation System for Smart Emergency Response 

## Project Vision

In critical medical emergencies, every second counts. One of the major hurdles in timely patient care is the delay faced by ambulances due to traffic congestion, poor route planning, and lack of real-time navigation support. ResQRoute aims to address this issue by leveraging Deep Learning and Al to build an intelligent ambulance navigation system.

The system dynamically suggests the fastest and most efficient route by analyzing real-time traffic data, road closures, and hospital availability. Furthermore, the system automatically coordinates with nearby hospitals, providing them with the patient's estimated time of arrival and critical updates to prepare for immediate medical attention. This solution has the potential to save lives by significantly reducing response and travel times in emergencies.
